# Metapsi

Metapsi is a full stack .NET platform that encapsulates its own architecture & practices. It is based on two main components:



## Metapsi.Runtime

The server-side architecture provides a flexible way to wire-up events, commands & requests. It solves the problem of out of order events that sometimes plague async programming.



## Metapsi.Module

End result: __Client side C#.__

Metapsi uses C# as a metaprogramming language that generates JavaScript.
